To update the simplifier project, you need to either upload the zipped guides folder or the zipped resources folder. I haven't figured out how to upload both at the same time without confusing it.

Do NOT delete all the files in the simplifier project or else the Implementation Guide links will be broken somehow.

## Updating the Implementation Guide

- Commit and push your changes to git
- Zip the guides folder
- Sign into the simplifier project and choose Upload -> "Upload file"
- Upload the zip file
- Update the "Last Updated" information on the main info page using the simplifier web UI: https://simplifier.net/ocean-cloud-connect-fhir-implementation-guide

## Updating the Resources / Profiles

- Commit and push your changes to git
- Zip the resources folder
- Sign into the simplifier project and choose Upload -> "Upload file"
- Upload the zip file
- Update the "Last Updated" information on the main info page using the simplifier web UI: https://simplifier.net/ocean-cloud-connect-fhir-implementation-guide
