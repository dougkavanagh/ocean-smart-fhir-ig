# DocumentReference

The DocumentReference endpoint is used to read and write general documents, PDFs, attachments, and other notes related to Ocean.

## Endpoint Usages

### GET /Patient/$everything

This resource may be returned in the $everything Bundle, particularly to hold a user's pre-selected note with an attachment as part of a contextual launch. For example, a user may select an ultrasound report, then initiate a contextual launch (SMART on FHIR) or trigger a patient upload via the Ocean portal. From here, Ocean will call the $everything operation and will receive the note and the ultrasound PDF as a DocumentReference. See the $everything operation definition in this project for details.
### POST DocumentReference

Used by Ocean to upload a note. The note's audience may be primarily for the clinician or for the secretarial staff, depending on the use case.

Typically the document "author" is the patient, since most Ocean notes are indirectly generated by the patient while interacting with the platform via a form or questionnaire of some sort.
