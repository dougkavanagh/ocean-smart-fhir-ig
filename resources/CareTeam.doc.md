# CareTeam

CareTeam resources **are not currently used by Ocean**.

The CareTeam could be returned in the future via the Patient/$everything endpoint. CareTeams would theoretically enable Ocean to permit certain actions based on alternate practitioners, not just the primary provider assocated with the "generalPractitioner" field in the Patient resource. For example, certain schedules could be made available as long as a Patient has the practitioner in the CareTeam.
